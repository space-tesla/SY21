Model the following Medical information as a graph model, and answerthe
following queries using Cypher.
There are various brands of medicine like Dr. Reddy, Cipla, SunPharma etc.
Their uses vary across different states in India. The uses of medicine is
measuredas %, with a high use defined as >=90%, Medium Use between 50
to 90%, and Low Use<50%. Each medicine manufactures various types of
medicine products like Tablet, Syrup, and Powder etc.
1. Identify the labels and relationships, along with their properties, and drawa
high-level Graph model. [3]
2. Create nodes and relationships, along with their properties, and visualize
your actual Graph model. [3]
3. Answer the following queries using Cypher:
a. List the names of different medicines considered in your graph [3]
b. List the medicine that are highly Used in Rajasthan. [3]
c. List the highly used tablet in Gujarat. [4]
d. List the medicine names manufacturing “Powder” [4]

# Step 1: Open MongoDB    using mongosh
mongosh

# Step 2: Create a database for the medical information system
use medical_information_db

# Step 3: Create collections for medicines, states, and types of medicines (Tablet, Syrup, Powder, etc.)
db.medicines.insertMany([
  { _id: 1, name: "Paracetamol", brand: "Dr. Reddy", type: "Tablet", state: "Rajasthan", use_percentage: 95 },
  { _id: 2, name: "Ibuprofen", brand: "Cipla", type: "Syrup", state: "Gujarat", use_percentage: 85 },
  { _id: 3, name: "Aspirin", brand: "SunPharma", type: "Powder", state: "Rajasthan", use_percentage: 92 },
  { _id: 4, name: "Cetirizine", brand: "Cipla", type: "Tablet", state: "Gujarat", use_percentage: 70 },
  { _id: 5, name: "Amoxicillin", brand: "Dr. Reddy", type: "Syrup", state: "Maharashtra", use_percentage: 60 },
  { _id: 6, name: "Metformin", brand: "SunPharma", type: "Tablet", state: "Rajasthan", use_percentage: 99 }
])

# Step 4: Write the Cypher queries to fetch the required results

# a. List the names of different medicines considered in the graph
db.medicines.aggregate([
  { $project: { name: 1 } },
  { $group: { _id: "$name" } }
])

# b. List the medicine that are highly used in Rajasthan (use_percentage >= 90%)
db.medicines.aggregate([
  { $match: { state: "Rajasthan", use_percentage: { $gte: 90 } } },
  { $project: { name: 1, use_percentage: 1 } }
])

# c. List the highly used tablet in Gujarat (use_percentage >= 90%)
db.medicines.aggregate([
  { $match: { state: "Gujarat", type: "Tablet", use_percentage: { $gte: 90 } } },
  { $project: { name: 1, use_percentage: 1 } }
])

# d. List the medicine names manufacturing "Powder"
db.medicines.aggregate([
  { $match: { type: "Powder" } },
  { $project: { name: 1 } }
])

# Step 5: Exit MongoDB   
exit
